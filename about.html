            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <section class="history">
                <p><span>I am the Chief Operating</span> Officer for Bently Enterprises, overseeing operations across ten business entities and over 140 employees under a private owner. Each company specializes in different industries, including commercial real estate, alternative fuel, agriculture, cattle, and spirits.</p>
                <p>While each business requires a unique strategy, operation, employee type, and subculture, they also share a synonym of values. My responsibilities include ensuring ethical standards are established and embraced by working closely alongside the CFO and reporting directly to the CEO. Reporting directly to me are a series of business-specific general managers and shared services directors; these include a ranch general manager, distillery general manager, security director, director of sales and events, director of real estate and legal, and the director of creative and technology.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I lead all shared services. These departments include legal (civil and criminal), technology, marketing, events, HR, and security. In each case, I work closely with the CFO to align key performance measures across businesses while addressing financial needs, private wealth management, staffing concerns, and risk management. Finally, all new ventures begin with business strategy and execution according to the CEO's general vision.</p>
                <p>Before COO, I was an Art & Technology Director, directly involved in the curation, management, and execution of creative and technical requirements for various industries. I’ve designed for names such as William Sonoma, the GAP, Nike, Harley Davidson, Snap-on, the Smithsonian, ComEd, Verizon, and AT&amp;T.</p>
                <p>My passion for creating art, and the technological refinements to achieve design solutions, pave the way for developing people. I’ve built a team of leaders over the past decade in an environment that embraces collaboration. My experience includes management guidance, employee development, property management, corporate governance, oversight of business litigation, mediation, and negotiation. Corporate social responsibility, business ethics, diversity leadership, responsible restructuring, and international business management remain guiding interests. Additionally, I continue to develop my background in computer technology, front-end coding, marketing, graphic design, and print production in both traditional and digital mediums.</p>
                <p>Growing up in a military family, I’ve lived across the United States. I enjoy traveling with my wife and daughter to see family and explore new places. I’m an avid reader and am currently studying Mandarin and writing simplified Chinese, watching baseball or basketball, playing video games with my daughter, or drinking too much coffee.</p>
